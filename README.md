## ROADMAP

### Popups

- Better UI for the popups
- Fix the bugs

### API

- Back up / cache API results? (SPOF)

### Known issues
 
 * Creatures don't get displayed properly by React because the component that transforms the API response into a table has a [bug](https://github.com/thehyve/react-json-to-table/pull/11#pullrequestreview-401831293)
 * I have [forked the repo] in the meantime, and this needs to be npm installed locally on any machine running the app.
